# nd-assessment-tools
"nd" stands for "Neuro developmental". The goal of this repository is to offer tools for performing assessments such as ADOS, ADI-R or the Vineland protocol. Since many of these are commercially protected, this solution separates application code from content so that the latter can remain private if necessary.
