# Development journal

This document details changes made to the system during its development, mostly for didactical purposes.
It can also offer insights into the development process.

After conceiving the main project idea and choosing the technology stack, set up the Github repository.
Tech stack:

- Frontend: Vanilla PHP. Will add libraries and frameworks later.
- Backend: Vanilla PHP. Will introduce Laravel later.
- Database: MySQL.

The reason for these choices is mostly because I want to deepen my understanding of web application development, and showcase my PHP skills. I'm aware that there are more modern alternatives for web dev such as React, Next, Svelte and other JS frameworks. I will later do another project using those.
Also, I want to start as vanilla as possible, that is without external libraries or frameworks. Then, I will introduce them. This is mostly for myself, so that I can better understand the basics.

Got the PHP hello world running using Apache 2. Documented the process in the README, in the "Development environment setup" section.

Pivoted to using Laravel as a full-stack framework for developing both frontend and backend.
Watched a Laravel bootcamp course on YouTube, installed all the dependencies and created a working Laravel hello world app.
Documented the whole process in README.md.
